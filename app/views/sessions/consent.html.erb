4. Why is this research being done?

This research study is about understanding the pathways of engineering service alumni following their academic careers 
as students. This research is trying to determine where these alumni have gone, regionally and in their occupations, 
as well as the reasons	for these pathways. It is not well known how much engineering service affects future career choices 
and values.

5. How long will the research last?

We expect that the survey will take 10-15 minutes.

6. How many people will be studied?

We expect about 650 people in the entire study nationally.

7. What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?

Through this online survey tool, you will be asked a series of multiple choice and free response questions. 
These relate to your recent educational and occupational histories, as well as what motivated transitions between 
activities. Brief demographic questions are also asked.

8. What happens if I do not want to be in this research?

You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you.

9. What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?

You can leave the research at any time; it will not be held against you.

10. What happens to the information collected for the research?

We plan to publish the results of the study. None of the published information will be traceable to individual respondents.
Results will be presented as an aggregate from the respondents or de-identified. Efforts will be made to limit the use and
disclosure of your personal information to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete 
secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this 
organization, and members of the research team including the principal investigator (Rulifson), the advising 
professor (Bielefeldt) and Nathan Canney, a research colleague at Seattle University.

11. What else do I need to know?

This research is being funded by the National Science Foundation.
